And Lover feels like a return to the fundamental songwriting pillars that I usually build my house on. It's really honest; it's not me playing a character. It's really just how I feel, undistilled. And there are a lot of very personal admissions in it. And also, I love a metaphor. I've loved building on the metaphor for a very long time. You know, the whole of reputation was just a metaphor, but [Lover] is a very personal record. So that's been really fun.”\n– Taylor Swift on Rolling Stone."}}}
